	the owning of a private petrol car in 2016 was about 500 euros/month.

<p>According to <a

		target="_blank">Eurostat Statistics</a> and <a
		href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/many-europeans-still-exposed-to-air-pollution-2015/premature-deaths-attributable-to-air-pollution"
		target="_blank">European Environmental Agency</a> data the deaths due
	to air pollution are about ten times more frequent than road incidents!
</p>

<p>This does not mean of course that road safety is not a relevant issue
	as well, but that even if not immediately self-evident air pollution in
	our territories is a relevant health threat that our societies need to
	face with decisiveness. In the <a
		href="www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/many-europeans-still-exposed-to-air-pollution-2015/premature-deaths-attributable-to-air-pollution"
		target="_blank">European Environmental Agency</a> website you can find
	more information and data about these issues (in all EU languages).

<p>According to the <a
		href="http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_adults/en/"
		target="_blank">World Health Organization</a> the recommended amount
	of moderate physical activity (encompassing leisure activities like
	walking, dancing, gardening, hiking, swimming or transportation ones
	like walking or cycling) should be minimum 150 minutes throughout the
	week (to be performed in bouts of at least 10 minutes duration).
</p>

<p>This is very useful in order to improve cardiorespiratory and
	muscular fitness, bone health, reduce the risk of NCDs and depression!
	Using active transportation modes can help you reaching these goals,
	improving our health (and at the same time environmental conditions).</p>
